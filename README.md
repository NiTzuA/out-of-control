# Out of Control!

A game I challenged myself to make within 3 days (which I unfortunately failed, why it did take me around 12 hours to make, it was over the span of 1-2 weeks due to motivation issues). The gimmick was that the players would be out of control, which birthed the idea wherein the controls are literally something they must collect, hence "out of control".

# Features
- 5 levels...
- A system where the player must collect their controls.
- Spikes!

# Personal Notes
- This game was essentially axed due to me realizing that puzzle might not be the best genre for improving at game development, as while I was making this game, I found myself thinking more about the puzzle layout than actually creating features for the game, and I didn't really like that, so I slapped an ending and just shipped it so I could move on to the next project. I may or may not remaster this game in the near future.
